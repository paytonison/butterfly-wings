Your story, “The Butterfly’s Powdered Wings,” is about a ghost that uses the appearance of butterflies to mask her true face so she can regain her strength to find her final resting place.

What’s working
The descriptions in this story are so vivid and wonderfully written. Each sentence paints a beautiful artwork in my head that borders on grotesque surrealism. I saw in your email that this originally began as a screenplay, and it’s evident that’s the case as the language and descriptions lend themselves to what’d be a gorgeous production design. It’s beautiful all around.

What needs work
With that said, there are times when the amount of description becomes too much and overtakes the story. The story is 13 pages long, but less than a quarter of that includes either characterization or plot advancement. It’s fine to have rich, vivid descriptions—it shows your skills as a writer and your ability to master the craft—but without advancing the plot or adding to the characters, it becomes a slog: beautiful, but no substance. A good story should be able to blend masterful description, plot, and characters. As it stands, the story only has one aspect.

Additionally, I had difficulty caring about the main character’s quest to find her final resting place. This dovetails from the lack of characterization. If I can’t get behind a character’s motivation, then I don’t care about them, and that’s a kiss of death for a story.

Finally, dialogue tags would help the story tremendously. Multiple times, I had difficulty discerning who was speaking, which affected the characterization when that’s something sorely needed.

Overall, it’s a terrifically described story that needs a few finishing touches to make it stand out. It’s one thing to make a good screenplay that captures the eye, but it’s another thing to make a good story that captures both the mind’s eye and makes the reader care for what’s going on.
